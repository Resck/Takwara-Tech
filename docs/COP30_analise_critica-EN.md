## **Executive Summary**

This report presents a consolidated critical analysis of Brazilian climate policy during its presidency of COP30 in Belém in November 2025\. The analysis exposes a fundamental "dual face": Brazil projects an image of global climate leadership, centered on the economic thesis of the "standing forest", while this narrative is simultaneously undermined by political contradictions and structural implementation failures.

**The Political Contradiction (High-Level Analysis):**

Brazil's diplomatic leadership at COP30 is weakened by two main contradictions:

1. **The Amphibology of Deforestation Data:** The government selectively uses consolidated annual data (PRODES 2025), which shows a "significant drop," as a "diplomatic asset." However, it ignores real-time alert data (DETER) from the same period, which reveals an 8.4% *increase* in alerts, driven by forest fires.  
2. **The Fossil Paradox:** The most flagrant contradiction is the active promotion of fossil fuel expansion, notably the license for drilling at the Mouth of the Amazon River. This policy is classified by NGOs as "alarming hypocrisy" and "nonsensical".

**The Implementation Dichotomy (Ground-Level Analysis):**

Complementing this political contradiction, a technical analysis of "standing forest" projects reveals a profound dichotomy between scientific potential and the reality of governance:

1. **On one side, robust scientific advances:** The Brazilian academy has demonstrated the ability to value the forest. This includes new methodologies (UNESP/Sassari) that quantify carbon more accurately than the IPCC and new economic paradigms (UFPA/NAEA) for the "bioeconomy of socio-biodiversity".  
2. **On the other, critical governance failures:** These advances are undermined by land tenure chaos. Serious allegations in Pará (Breves and Portel) expose "carbon neocolonialism": companies (like Eco Mapuá) use the self-declared Rural Environmental Registry (CAR)—a "land tenure metaverse"—to sell credits on territories of traditional communities without prior consultation.

**Consolidated Conclusion:**

The central challenge of Brazilian climate policy is not a lack of science to value the forest. The challenge is the structural failure of the State to establish effective land governance. This "profound land tenure debility" allows the political biases of "nationalist developmentalism" and "institutional greenwashing" to dominate the agenda. In the absence of regulation and territorial control, the market instruments (Article 6), promoted by Brazil in the "Blue Zone" of COP30, become, in practice, tools for "green grabbing" and the dispossession of community rights.

## **Part I: The Belém Stage – The Official Narrative and the Backstage of COP30**

In mid-November 2025, COP30 in Belém represents the apex of Brazil's diplomatic effort to reposition itself as a global climate protagonist. The official narrative focuses on consolidating this role through an ambitious technical and financial agenda.

### **1.1 The Progress of Negotiations: The Quest for Diplomatic Leadership**

Brazil's diplomatic activity was characterized by a proactive strategy to avoid the "stalling" of discussions, focusing on climate finance, trade regulation, and the "lack of ambition" in other countries' NDCs. The centerpiece of the narrative was the launch of the "Belém Declaration," which aims to consolidate a "global green industrialization agenda".

This emphasis on "green industrialization" frames the climate crisis as an economic opportunity for the private sector, aligning with business interests. The message is clear: decarbonization will be pursued *through* market mechanisms.

### **1.2 The Financial Axis: The "Baku-Belém" Roadmap**

The main financial "deliverable" under negotiation is the consolidation of climate finance. After the insufficient results of COP29 in Baku ($300 billion/year), Belém inherited the responsibility of proving the viability of multilateralism.

To manage this expectation, the presidencies launched the "Baku to Belém Roadmap for $1.3 Trillion". This roadmap functions as a diplomatic mechanism to manage the previous failure and create a narrative of progress, even if the mobilization of $1.3 trillion is still considered "far" from being achieved.

### **1.3 The Technical Axis: The Carbon Market Debate (Article 6\)**

The dominant technical axis is the regulation of carbon markets (Article 6). Brazil has taken an active leadership role, proposing the "worldwide integration of carbon markets". This strong defense of a regulated market is directly linked to Brazil's main comparative advantage: the Amazon. By leading the regulation of Article 6, Brazil attempts to *create, regulate, and capture* the economic value of its vast carbon sink, a clear economic policy of nature *commoditization*.

---

## **Part II: The "Standing Forest" Thesis – The Dual Face of Theory and Practice**

Brazil's diplomatic credibility (Part I) rests on the economic thesis of the "standing forest". This thesis argues that conservation and economic development are synergistic. However, an analysis of its implementation reveals a deep fracture between scientific potential and market practice.

### **2.1 The Promise (Macro-Level): The Think Tank Strategy**

At the macro level, "standing forest" has evolved into a business and bioeconomy model. This approach is supported by an ecosystem of technical reports seeking to quantify and monetize Amazonian carbon.

* **The Value of Carbon (Instituto Escolhas):** Reports like that of Instituto Escolhas quantify the potential for REDD+ credits in forest concessions (5.6 million credits/year, or $24 million/year), arguing this revenue could increase concession revenues by 43%. This study actively subsidized Bill (PL) No. 5.518/2020, in a deliberate chain of political influence to create a new market.  
* **The Governance of Carbon (ISPN and Amazon Fund):** Reports like that of ISPN analyze the impact of community projects (PPP–ECOS) financed by the Amazon Fund, demonstrating the ability to combine "conservation and development" at the local level. The Amazon Fund, managed by BNDES, is Brazil's main REDD+ mechanism and attracts international confidence, such as the €20 million donation from the EU during COP30.

### **2.2 The Scientific and Economic Vanguard (The Potential)**

In parallel with COP30, a panel at the Federal University of Pará (UFPA) detailed the robust scientific basis that supports the *potential* of the "standing forest" thesis:

* **Carbon Quantification (UNESP/Sassari):** A new carbon quantification methodology was presented, validated by the journal *Scientific Reports*. This methodology criticizes IPCC standards (which suggest sampling at 30 cm depth) for drastically underestimating carbon in tropical soils. In Acará (PA), the UNESP/CHN methodology found 211 tons/ha, compared to 111 tons/ha by the IPCC method—an increase of 90%. The goal, according to the researchers, is to be "fair and precise".  
* **Economic Paradigm (UFPA/NAEA):** Economists from the Center for Advanced Amazonian Studies (NAEA) presented the "bioeconomy of socio-biodiversity" paradigm. This model contrasts the "organic" logic (diversity management, traditional knowledge) with the "mechanical-chemical" logic (homogenization, industrial scale). They warned of the risk of "açaí-ization," where global market pressure transforms a product of biodiversity into a monoculture.  
* **Soil Health (USP/ESALQ):** Researchers from ESALQ/USP argued that the correct metric for agriculture is not the "Carbon Footprint" (emissions only), but the "Carbon Balance" (Inputs \- Outputs). The central thesis is that "there is no possibility of this balance being neutral or negative if we do not keep the forest standing," proving the interdependence between production and conservation.

### **2.3 The Fractured Implementation (The Reality)**

The same panel that presented the scientific potential (2.2) exposed how the practical implementation of these concepts is being corrupted by governance and market failures:

* **The Positive Side (Voluntary PES):** The "Aripuanã-Guariba" (Southern Amazonas) case study was presented, a partnership with INCRA. Using the "Unesp methodology," the "conservation credit" (PES) project is financing what the State fails to deliver in an area "dominated by bandits": masonry bathrooms, biodigester septic tanks, and artesian wells for families in extreme vulnerability. The conclusion is that the standing forest "transforms lives".  
* **The Negative Side (Carbon Neocolonialism):** In direct contrast, Prof. Carlos Augusto Ramos (UFPA) denounced serious conflicts in REDD+ projects in Pará.  
  * **Breves Case (Eco Mapuá):** The Eco Mapuá company used the CAR to register 53,000 hectares overlapping two federal Extractive Reserves (RESEX), with the aim of "selling carbon credits" to families who were unaware of the project.  
  * **Portel Case:** The municipality has 154% of its territory covered by CAR. About 1 million hectares of carbon projects overlap with settlements, featuring 30-year contracts and "paltry" benefit-sharing (stoves, food baskets).  
  * **Publication:** This allegation was formalized in the article "Carbon and Neocolonialism," which estimates the value of these projects at $115 million, characterizing them as "spoliation and expropriation".

## **Part III: Contradictory Evidence 1 – The Amphibology of Deforestation Data (2024-2025)**

The "standing forest" thesis, based on REDD+ results-based payments, depends on the continuous reduction of deforestation. However, official INPE data from 2024-2025 reveals a politically used contradiction.

### **3.1 The Success Narrative: The "Diplomatic Asset" of PRODES**

The government uses the consolidated PRODES 2025 data (Aug/24-Jul/25) as its main "diplomatic asset". This data indicates a "significant drop" (5,796 km²), the "third lowest rate in the historical series," credited to a 26% increase in IBAMA embargoes and R$ 3.64 billion from the Amazon Fund. PRODES, being the official "clear-cut" rate, is the metric used to justify international confidence.

### **3.2 The Crisis Narrative: The Increase in DETER Alerts**

In contradiction, DETER data (real-time alerts) shows a reversal. Reports from the government itself indicate that deforestation *rose 8.4%* in the accumulated period of August 2024 to June 2025\.

The official explanation exposes the contradiction: the MMA secretary, André Lima, explained that the increase was influenced by **fires in primary forests**. DETER data showed that while "deforestation with exposed soil" (clear-cut) fell by 3.3%, areas of "deforestation with vegetation" (fire) **grew by 245.7%**.

The government is caught in an "amphibology": diplomatically, it uses past data (PRODES) to claim success; internally, it admits the present crisis (DETER) caused by fires, demonstrating a *data selection bias*.

### **Table 1: The Contradictory Analysis of Deforestation Data in the Amazon (2024-2025)**

| Metric / System | Source(s) | Reference Period | Reported Result | Analysis / Political Bias |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **PRODES 2025** | (MARIOTTI REGEN, 2025; INPE, 2025a) | Annual (Aug 2024 \- Jul 2025\) | **"Significant Drop"**. 5,796 km². Third lowest historical rate. | **The "Diplomatic Asset"**. Used at COP30 to prove success and attract funds. Focuses on "clear-cut". |
| **DETER** | (AGÊNCIA GOV, 2025a; 2025b) | Accumulated (Aug 2024 \- Jun 2025\) | **8.4% Increase**. | **The Emerging Crisis.** Explained by the government as a 245.7% increase in "deforestation with vegetation" (fire). |
| **ICV** (Inst. Centro de Vida) | (ICV, 2025\) | Annual (Aug 2024 \- Jul 2025\) | **90% of deforestation was illegal.** | **The Governance Failure.** Regardless of quantity, the *quality* of deforestation is mostly illegal. |

---

## **Part IV: Contradictory Evidence 2 – The Fossil Paradox of the Amazonian Host**

If the deforestation data (Part III) undermines the *metric* of climate policy, the fossil fuel expansion undermines its *essence*. This is the most flagrant contradiction of COP30.

### **4.1 The "Alarming Hypocrisy": Expansion at the Mouth of the Amazon**

IBAMA's decision to grant, under pressure, research licenses for Petrobras to drill in the Foz do Amazonas basin is the epicenter of the controversy.

* The **Socio-Environmental Institute (ISA)** classifies the decision as a "shadow of nonsense" that "weakens the country's climate discourse".  
* The **Global Oil & Gas Exit List (GOGEL) 2025** report (Urgewald and Arayara International Institute) denounces an "alarming level of climate hypocrisy". The report identifies Petrobras as the 15th largest explorer in the world. The exploration threatens a 9,300 km² coral reef system and could release 4.7 billion tons of $\\text{CO}\_2$ equivalent.  
* The **Climate Action Network (RAC)** denounced Brazil's "ambivalence" for granting the license on the eve of COP30.

### **4.2 The Rhetoric of Contradiction and Fossil-Fueled Logistics**

The government publicly admits the "difficulties and contradictions," justifying that oil profits would (supposedly) be used to finance the energy transition. This logic is *institutional greenwashing*, as it requires the *expansion* of fossil fuel activity to finance its reduction.

This contradiction is visible in the event's logistics, with delegates housed in "diesel-powered cruise ships". Politically, COP30 set a record with **1,600 fossil fuel industry lobbyists** accredited, a number that exceeds the size of almost all national delegations, except for Brazil's.

---

## **Part V: The Independent Assessment – The Failure of Brazilian Ambition (NDCs and Global Emissions)**

Independent technical assessments expose the inadequacy of Brazil's climate commitments.

### **5.1 The Global Scenario: The 1.5°C Goal is "Practically Unfeasible"**

The **Global Carbon Budget 2025** report, presented at COP30, indicates that global fossil $\\text{CO}\_2$ emissions are set to *increase by 1.1% in 2025*, reaching a record high. The conclusion is that "it is probably too late for $1.5^\\circ\\text{C}$," and that 1.7°C is the "more plausible" objective.

Ironically, the report praises Brazil for its 2024 emissions reduction, a result driven *solely by the drop in deforestation* (the PRODES metric). Brazil is thus praised for a *metric of yesterday* (deforestation) while accelerating the *action of today* (fossil expansion) that the report condemns.

### **5.2 The Critique of Brazil's NDC (Climate Observatory)**

The Climate Observatory (OC), in an analysis of Brazil's second NDC (2031-2035), concludes that the country's ambition is inadequate:

1. **Goals Not Aligned with 1.5°C:** The target (1.05 GtCO2e) would not lead Brazil to carbon neutrality by 2050\.  
2. **Permissiveness with Deforestation:** The NDC "allows for high levels of legal deforestation," indicating the "zero deforestation" promise will not be met.  
3. **The Fossil Silence:** The most severe criticism is that Brazil "owes an explanation for its fossil fuel expansion plans," about which the NDC remains silent.

---

## **Part VI: Concluding Report – The Political Biases and the Structural Failure**

The observed contradictions are not accidental; they are the result of political forces and structural failures vying for the national agenda.

### **6.1 Bias 1: Nationalist Developmentalism (The Aldo Rebelo Doctrine)**

The engine behind the fossil paradox (Part IV) is a developmentalist and nationalist bias that views the environmental agenda as a threat to sovereignty. Figures like Aldo Rebelo have called COP30 a "political fiasco" and accuse NGOs of being a "parallel government". For this faction, oil exploration at the Mouth of the Amazon is not a climate problem; it is an affirmation of *sovereignty*.

### **6.2 Bias 2: Institutional Greenwashing (The Lula and Marina Rhetoric)**

The second force is the federal government itself, acting as a mediator between Bias 1 and the international community. The strategy is *institutional greenwashing*:

* **Ambiguous Rhetoric:** It admits the "contradictions" (oil) and launches bold rhetorical proposals (a roadmap to end fossils) that contradict its domestic actions.  
* **Using Protest as Virtue:** The government uses the *existence* of the "Peoples' Summit" (the civil society parallel event) as proof of democratic "advancement," even as the central *demands* of that protest (ending oil exploration in the Amazon) are systematically ignored.  
* **The Diplomatic Asset:** The "standing forest" thesis is the main greenwashing asset, focusing on the *only positive indicator* (the drop in PRODES deforestation) to divert attention from failures (fossils, methane, weak NDCs).

### **6.3 Bias 3: The Exclusion of Climate Justice and the Governance Failure**

The final contradiction is the *exclusion* of civil society demands (social justice, rights, demarcation) from official negotiations, which focus on market solutions. COP30 is two conferences: the "Peoples' Summit" in the streets demanding rights, and the "Blue Zone" (official) dominated by technicians and 1,600 fossil lobbyists discussing markets.

The analysis of the UFPA panel (Report 2\) exposes that this bias is not just rhetorical; it is **structural and enabled by land governance failures**:

* **The Root Cause (The "Profound Land Tenure Debility"):** Brazil has **50 million hectares of undesignated public lands** in the Amazon. Prof. Richard Toziano (FAO/UN) describes this as a governance vacuum, where the State does not know its own territory, making it a target for land grabbing.  
* **The Tool (The "Land Tenure Metaverse"):** Prof. Carlos Ramos (UFPA) defines the CAR (Rural Environmental Registry) as the "Land Tenure Metaverse". Being "self-declaratory" amidst land tenure chaos, the CAR has become an instrument of "reality simulation" used to legitimize land grabbing and fraudulent carbon projects (like those in Breves and Portel).  
* **The Consequence (The "Green Grabbing"):** This governance vacuum (land debility) and the tool (CAR) enable "Green Grabbing". Prof. Toziano identified the **Fiagro Law** (Law 14.130/2021) as a legal loophole to Law 5.709/1971 (which limits land purchase by foreigners), allowing international funds to bypass sovereignty controls for green speculation.  
* **The Public-Private Structure:** The agreement between Pará and the LEAF Coalition (Nestlé, Bayer, etc.), executed by **CAAP S.A.** (Pará Environmental Assets and Holdings Company Inc., a mixed-capital corporation), was criticized for pricing carbon at $15/ton. This value is considered paltry compared to the "Social Cost of Carbon," estimated at $185/ton (Rennert et al., 2022).

The consolidated analysis proves that the "Blue Zone" (Report 1\) negotiates markets (Article 6\) that, on the ground (Report 2), operate upon a foundation of land tenure chaos, threatening rights and becoming a form of "carbon neocolonialism".
