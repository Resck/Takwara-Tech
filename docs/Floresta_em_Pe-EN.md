Event: Panel "Challenges for Maintaining the Standing Forest" (Parallel Event of the 30th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change – COP30)  
Date: November 15, 2025  
Location: Federal University of Pará (UFPA), Belém, Pará, Brazil

---

## **Executive Summary**

This report presents a critical analysis and source validation of the presentations given at the panel "Challenges for Maintaining the Standing Forest," held on November 15, 2025, at the Federal University of Pará (UFPA), as part of the COP30 events in Belém. The objective of this document is to correct the "shortcomings"—incomplete information, unattributed data, and missing bibliographic references—from the official event transcript 1, supplementing and validating the speakers' claims through external academic, institutional, and legal sources.

The analysis of the panel, which brought together seven experts from the fields of soil science, economics, carbon finance, and land governance, reveals a profound dichotomy that defines the current state of the climate debate in Brazil.

On one hand, the panel demonstrated robust scientific advances in the ability to value the forest. This includes:

1. A new carbon quantification methodology (UNESP/University of Sassari) that proves more accurate than IPCC standards by correcting significant underestimations in soil and leaf litter.2  
2. An economic paradigm (UFPA/NAEA) for the "bioeconomy of socio-biodiversity," which values traditional knowledge and diversity management in direct opposition to industrial homogenization ("Açaí-ization").4  
3. The centrality of "soil health" as a pillar for the climate resilience of agriculture, arguing for the interdependence between agricultural production and the standing forest.7

On the other hand, the panel exposed critical governance and market failures that fundamentally undermine these advances. The discussions revealed:

1. Serious allegations of socio-environmental conflicts in carbon projects in Pará (municipalities of Breves and Portel), where companies (like Eco Mapuá) use the Rural Environmental Registry (CAR) to legitimize the sale of credits over the territories of traditional communities (RESEX and settlements) without prior consultation, a phenomenon conceptualized as the "agrarian metaverse" and "carbon neocolonialism."9  
2. A systemic "profound land tenure insecurity," marked by 50 million hectares of undesignated public lands in the Amazon, which become the main vector for "land grabbing" and "green grabbing."1  
3. The creation of legal structures, such as the Fiagro Law 13, and public-private business models, like Pará's agreement with the LEAF Coalition via CAAP S.A. 14, which, in the absence of effective territorial governance, raise serious questions about sovereignty, benefit-sharing, and carbon pricing.1

The main challenge identified by the panel is not a lack of science to value the forest, nor a lack of capital to finance it. The central challenge is the structural failure of the State to establish transparent and effective land governance, allowing market instruments to operate in a regulatory vacuum that threatens the rights of communities and the very integrity of the ecosystem services they propose to save.

## **I. Institutional Opening and Contextualization**

The panel was mediated by (identified as Tiago Barreto 1) and organized by the Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP) in partnership with the Federal University of Pará (UFPA).1 Prof. Juliana, representing UNESP's Pro-Rectory of Extension and Prof. Raul Guimarães, highlighted the importance of the partnership with UFPA and "Globo Carbon."1

Prof. Iraê, from UNESP, defined the central objective of the event as the discussion on "maintaining the standing forest" 1, emphasizing the importance of ecosystem services for human life.

Notably, Prof. Iraê informed of the absence of the keynote speaker, Prof. Paulo Artacho (USP), who, according to the speaker, "was summoned last night by the COP coordinator."1 This absence required Prof. Iraê, a soil specialist, to begin the panel with a general contextualization of climate change, which led him to cite scientific publications that require validation.

## **II. Analysis of Presentation 1: Prof. Iraê (UNESP)**

**Presentation Title:** "Carbon Quantification and Ecosystem Services Aiming at Forest Preservation."1

Discourse Analysis:  
Prof. Iraê structured his speech in two parts: a climate contextualization (filling in for Prof. Artacho) and the presentation of his core research.

1. **Climate Context:**  
   * **Claim 1.1:** The speaker cited an "article in Nature in 2021" 1 that mapped the temperature increase over the last 24,000 years, with an abrupt acceleration in the last 6,000 years.  
   * **Claim 1.2:** He cited data from the Astronomical and Geological Institute (IAG) of USP 1 on the increase in extreme events in São Paulo.  
   * **Claim 1.3:** He referenced a "work by Professor Lau" 1 that classifies the planet's main carbon reservoirs in the order: 1st Ocean, 2nd Soil, 3rd Vegetation.  
2. The UNESP/Sassari Methodology:  
   The core of the presentation was a critique of the standard carbon quantification methodology recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the presentation of an alternative methodology, developed in partnership with the University of Sassari (Italy) since 2015.1  
   * **Critique 1 (Soil Depth):** The IPCC suggests soil sampling to a minimum depth of 30 cm.1 The speaker demonstrated, based on a doctoral thesis (student Deise) in the Atlantic Forest (Botucatu), that this depth is insufficient. The study found 74 tons of carbon/hectare (ton/ha) from 0-30 cm, but an additional 76 ton/ha from 30-100 cm. The standard methodology, therefore, ignored more than 50% of the soil carbon.1  
   * **Critique 2 (Analysis Method):** The standard method for fertility (Walkley-Black) 1 underestimated carbon. By using the Elemental Analyzer (CHN), which burns the sample and measures total carbon, the result jumped from 129 ton/ha to 181 ton/ha—an increase of 40%.1  
   * **Critique 3 (Leaf Litter):** The IPCC suggests a 50% conversion factor (dry weight to carbon).1 The CHN analysis in the Botucatu forests revealed a content of only 38%, an overestimation of 24% by the IPCC method.1 The speaker emphasized that the goal is not to inflate numbers, but to be "fair and accurate."1  
   * **Research Validation:** The speaker stated that this work was published in the journal *Scientific Reports*.1  
   * **Application in the Amazon:** The methodology was applied in Acará (PA), in partnership with the Piabiru Institute.1 The results in the Amazon were even more discrepant: 211 ton/ha (UNESP/CHN method) versus 111 ton/ha (IPCC method), an increase of 90%.1

**Correction of Shortcomings and External Validation:**

* **Reference 1.1 (Nature 2021):** The claim 1 refers to the study by Osman et al. (2021), published in *Nature*. The research used climate models to reconstruct global temperatures since the Last Glacial Maximum (24,000 years ago), confirming that the magnitude and rate of modern anthropogenic warming are "unprecedented."16  
* **Reference 1.3 (Prof. Lau):** The claim 1 about carbon reservoirs (Ocean \> Soil \> Vegetation) is a scientific consensus widely documented in the IPCC reports themselves, although the identity of "Professor Lau" could not be confirmed by the sources.  
* **Methodology Reference (Scientific Reports):** The claim 1 is validated. Articles 2 confirm the publication of the research led by Prof. Iraê Guerrini 3 in the journal *Scientific Reports* (of the *Nature* group). The reports confirm the presentation's points: the critique of the IPCC's 30 cm depth (insufficient for tropical soils) and the proposal to extend it to 1 meter, in addition to the use of more precise equipment (elemental analyzer) to correct the underestimation of carbon.2  
* **Project Reference (Acará):** The claim 1 is validated. The "Casa da Floresta" (House of the Forest) 21 is the initiative of the UNESP-Instituto Piabiru partnership in the municipality of Acará (PA), serving as a reference center for social technologies and a UNESP research base in the Amazon.24

## **III. Analysis of Presentation 2: Prof. Danilo Fernandes (UFPA/NAEA)**

**Presentation Title:** "The Bioeconomy of Socio-biodiversity and its Importance for the Preservation and Conservation of Tropical Forests."1

Discourse Analysis:  
Prof. Danilo Fernandes, an economist from the Center for Advanced Amazonian Studies (NAEA) at UFPA 1, presented a theoretical and empirical analysis of development models in the Amazon.

1. **The Dichotomy of Paradigms:** The presentation contrasted two productive logics:  
   * **Mechanical-Chemical (Industrialist) Paradigm:** Treats nature as "dead nature."1 Its logic is standardization and homogenization for economies of scale (e.g., monocultures).1  
   * **Organic Paradigm (Biome Bioeconomy):** Treats nature as "living nature."1 Its logic is the management of diversity, based on "traditional (tacit) knowledge" and "endogenous knowledge."1 It is defined as the "bioeconomy of socio-biodiversity."1  
2. **Distinct Economic Rationales:** The speaker argued that the agents of these paradigms are different and cannot be modeled in the same way.  
   * **Example of Açaí:** A family producer of açaí, upon reaching a good price, stops harvesting, as their goal is "well-being" and optimizing family labor.1 A businessman, in the same situation, increases production to "maximize profit."1  
3. **Measuring the (Hidden) Bioeconomy:** The speaker stated that the economy of socio-biodiversity is "underreported."1  
   * **Claim 2.1:** He cited "Professor Francisco de Assis Costa" 1 as the leader at NAEA in developing methodologies (input-output matrices) to estimate the real size of this economy.  
   * **Claim 2.2 (Data):** Based on these matrices, he estimated the GDP of the socio-biodiversity bioeconomy of Pará at R$ 7 billion.1 He stated that the export market (e.g., açaí) is small, about 3% 1, with the regional and national markets being the main drivers.  
   * **Claim 2.3 (The Threat of "Açaí-ization"):** The speaker warned 1 that pressure from the international market (the 3%) for scale is forcing the "homogenization of floodplain areas."1 Açaí, a product of the Organic Paradigm, risks being captured by the Mechanical-Chemical Paradigm, becoming a commodity and generating negative impacts, despite being a "forest product."1  
   * **Claim 2.4 (Dynamics):** Data from 20 years show that trajectories T1/T2 (peasant/diversity) grew by 4.2%, while T7 (employer/grains) grew by 9.7%.1 The conclusion is that systems that conserve do grow, but they lose relative space to homogeneous systems.

**Correction of Shortcomings and External Validation:**

* **Reference 2.1 (Prof. Francisco de Assis Costa):** The claim 1 is central and validated. Prof. Francisco de Assis Costa is a Full Professor at NAEA/UFPA 26 and the main academic reference for the input-output matrix methodology to measure the "Bioeconomy of socio-biodiversity in the state of Pará."5 His work substantiates the theoretical distinction between the agro-industrialist bioeconomy (mechanical-chemical) and the "bio-ecological bioeconomy" (organic) 4, as explained by Prof. Danilo.  
* **Reference 2.3 (Concept of "Açaí-ization"):** The claim 1 is validated. The term "Açaí-ization of the Amazon" is an academic neologism (e.g., Machado et al.) 6 that precisely describes the phenomenon of "forest impoverishment" 6 and "loss of autonomy" 6 caused by the transformation of açaí from a diverse extractive product to a "monoculture" 6 driven by global market demand.6

## **IV. Analysis of Presentation 3: Prof. Carlos Eduardo Serri (USP)**

**Presentation Title:** "Agriculture and livestock associated with forest preservation as a solution for mitigating global climate change."1

Discourse Analysis:  
Prof. Serri, from ESALQ/USP, sought to reconcile agriculture and livestock with the climate agenda, shifting the logic from conflict to interdependence.

1. **The Thesis of Interdependence:** The speaker acknowledged the "clear difficulty of relationship" 1 between the activities but argued that maintaining the forest is "essential for production systems to be maintained."1  
   * **Claim 3.1:** He cited the ABC+ program (Low-Carbon Agriculture) 1, which in its new version requires treating the "landscape in an integrated manner," including native vegetation.  
2. **The Correct Metric (Balance vs. Footprint):**  
   * **Critique:** The "Carbon Footprint" 1 metric is inadequate for agribusiness, as it only considers emissions (outputs) and ignores removals (inputs) via sequestration in soil and vegetation.1  
   * **Proposal:** The correct metric is the "Carbon Balance" (Inputs \- Outputs) 1, which should ideally be neutral or negative.  
   * **The Central Connection:** Prof. Serri made the central claim of his talk: "There is no possibility of this balance being neutral or negative if we do not keep the forest standing."1 The emission caused by forest conversion (deforestation) makes the balance equation impossible for agriculture to zero out.  
3. **Tools and Publications:**  
   * **Claim 3.2:** He introduced CCARBON (Center for Carbon Studies and Tropical Agriculture) 1, a research center at ESALQ/USP funded by FAPESP.1  
   * **Claim 3.3:** He promoted the "Soil health assessment kit" 1, a field tool developed at the center (led by Prof. Maurício Querubim) for producers.  
   * **Claim 3.4:** He cited an article "we published in Nature two months ago" 1 (context: Sept/Oct 2025\) showing that the resilience of production systems is only achieved with "vegetation components."  
   * **Claim 3.5:** He presented the e-book "Soil health in tropical ecosystems" 1, a free work with over 150 authors, launched at COP30.

**Correction of Shortcomings and External Validation:**

* **Reference 3.2 (CCARBON):** The claim 1 is validated. The CCARBON (Research Center on Carbon in Tropical Agriculture) 27 is a CEPID (Research, Innovation and Dissemination Center) of FAPESP (São Paulo Research Foundation) 27, based at ESALQ/USP and directed by Prof. Carlos Eduardo Pellegrino Cerri (the speaker).27  
* **Reference 3.4 (Nature Article):** The claim 1 of a specific article in *Nature* in the "last two months" (Sept/Oct 2025\) could not be corroborated by the provided research sources.8 The claim is noted but lacks external validation in this report.  
* **Reference 3.5 (E-book "Soil Health"):** The claim 1 is 100% validated. The sources 7 provide the full reference: **Saúde do solo em ecossistemas tropicais: a base para mitigação e adaptação às mudanças climáticas** (Soil health in tropical ecosystems: the basis for mitigation and adaptation to climate change). The e-book, edited by Maurício Roberto Cherubin, Carlos Roberto Pinheiro Junior, Lucas Pecci Canisares, and Carlos Eduardo Pellegrino Cerri (the speaker) 7, was published by FEALQ in 2025 (ISBN: 9786589722892).7 The participation of 150 authors and 59 institutions is confirmed.30

## **V. Analysis of Presentation 4: Prof. Antônio Ganga (University of Sassari)**

**Presentation Title:** "Evaluation of the physicochemical influence of soil physicochemical properties and land use history on the carbon stock in organic soils."1

Discourse Analysis:  
Prof. Antônio Ganga presented a case study from Sardinia (Italy), reinforcing the 10-year international collaboration 1 mentioned by Prof. Iraê.

1. **Context (Europe):** The research is part of the "European Soil Strategy for 2030" 1, which aims to improve soil quality on the continent.  
2. **Methodology (Sardinia):** The study compared carbon stocks in two distinct pedosystems (geological substrates) 1:  
   * **Site 1 (Monti):** On intrusive rock (granite), resulting in acidic soils (Cambisols).1  
   * **Site 2 (Santa Maria da Palma):** On limestone rock (limestone/loam), resulting in Luvisols.1  
3. **Land Use Variables:** In both sites, different land uses were compared:  
   * Natural forests (potential vegetation) of *Quercus* (e.g., *Quercus ilex* and *Quercus suber* \- Cork Oak).1  
   * Agroforestry systems.  
   * Vineyards (citing the local Vermentino variety 1) of different ages (3, 15, and 30 years).1  
4. **Results:** The speaker presented statistical analyses (PFA and PCA) 1 indicating that, although forests have a higher soil organic carbon (SOC) stock 1, the overall system behavior is strongly dominated by soil texture (derived from the parent rock) and chemical properties (like pH) altered by human management.1  
5. **Status:** The speaker concluded by stating that "the manuscript on this work is under review."1

**Correction of Shortcomings and External Validation:**

* **Research Line Reference:** Although the specific work presented 1 is under review, the sources 32 confirm that Prof. Antonio Ganga and his team at the University of Sassari have a robust history of publications on the topic. Previous studies, such as Francaviglia et al. (2017) and Salis et al. (2015), already analyzed "Organic carbon pools" 32 in Sardinia, specifically comparing *cork oak* (*Quercus suber*) forests with vineyards.32 The presentation, therefore, represents the continuation of a consolidated research line aligned with the partnership with UNESP.

## **VI. Analysis of Presentation 5: Prof. Alessandro Zabotto (Zabotto Ambiental)**

**Presentation Title:** "Conservation, valuation, paths to financing nature."1

Discourse Analysis:  
Prof. Alessandro Zabotto presented the operational and market perspective for financing conservation, focusing on case studies.

1. **Context (Urgency):** The speaker began by citing the drought in the Amazon (2023) 1, the 97% of deforestation linked to agricultural expansion (land grabbing/cattle) 1, and the evidence that the Amazon is becoming a carbon source.1  
2. **Regulatory Frameworks:**  
   * **International:** He cited the Kyoto Protocol (start of the carbon market) 1 and the Paris Agreement (2015), focusing on Article 6 regarding emissions trading.1  
   * **National:** He cited the two main Brazilian laws: the National Policy on Payments for Environmental Services (PES) (2021) 1 and the Carbon Market Law (SBCE).1  
3. **Case Study 1 (REDD+ / Regulated Market):**  
   * **Project:** "Red Mais Aueté Project" 1, located in Marabá (PA), covering 345,000 hectares of the Aueté Indigenous Land (Paracanã People).1  
   * **Methodology:** Uses the "new VERRA methodology" 1 for generating carbon credits (REDD+).  
   * **Financing:** The speaker highlighted that the project is financed by Dutch investors, criticizing that "the money usually comes from outside."1  
   * **Context:** The area is under extreme deforestation pressure (cattle and land grabbing).1  
4. **Case Study 2 (PES / Voluntary Market):**  
   * **Project:** "Aripuanã-Guariba" 1, in partnership with INCRA, in the Southern Amazon (Apuí/Lábrea region) 1, covering 145,000 hectares.  
   * **Methodology:** Uses the "Unesp methodology" 1, as presented by Prof. Iraê. The speaker differentiated this asset, calling it a "conservation credit" 1 and not a carbon credit (REDD+).  
   * **Social Context:** This region was described as "dominated by criminals."1 The project's socioeconomic census revealed extreme vulnerability: 50 families 1 with high illiteracy rates, a total lack of sanitation (they drink river water), lack of documents (ID cards), malaria, and unvaccinated children.1  
5. **The Presentation's Thesis:** Maintaining the standing forest, through these projects, generates resources that finance what the State fails to deliver. In Case 2 (Aripuanã), the project is financing the construction of masonry bathrooms with biodigester septic tanks 1, drilling artesian wells 1, and psychosocial support (which identified children with autism, securing pensions for them).1 The conclusion is that the standing forest "transforms lives."1

**Correction of Shortcomings and External Validation:**

* **Reference 5.1 (Amazon as Carbon Source):** The claim 1 about the Amazon becoming a carbon source refers to the influential study by Gatti et al. (2021), published in *Nature*, which demonstrated that the southeastern portion of the Amazon (where Case Study 1 is located) is already a net carbon source.  
* **Reference 5.2 (National Laws):** The claims 1 are validated. They refer to **Law No. 14,119 of January 13, 2021** (National PES Policy) and **Law No. 14,790 of December 29, 2023** (Establishes the Brazilian Emissions Trading System \- SBCE).  
* **Reference 5.3 (VERRA Methodology):** The claim 1 about the "new VERRA methodology" is validated. VERRA, the main certifier in the voluntary market, is indeed in a transition process to a new consolidated REDD methodology.35 The VERRA registry from April 2025 (close to the event) shows the "Ararajuba REDD+ Project" (likely the Aueté project or a neighboring one) open for public consultation, confirming registration activity.37  
* **Reference 5.4 (UNESP Methodology):** The claim 1 of using the UNESP methodology in Case 2 (Aripuanã) directly connects this presentation to Presentation 1 (Prof. Iraê). It demonstrates the commercial application of the academic methodology (validated by *Scientific Reports* 2) for a "conservation credit," a voluntary PES asset that uses independent auditing 1 based on UNESP's science.

## **VII. Analysis of Presentation 6: Prof. Carlos Augusto Ramos (UFPA)**

**Presentation Title:** "The case of private and public-private carbon markets in the state of Pará."1

Discourse Analysis:  
Prof. Carlos Augusto Ramos, a forestry engineer, doctoral student at INEAF/UFPA 1, and native of Portel, Marajó 1, presented the critical counterpoint to the carbon market, based on his research and social activism (e.g., Pastoral Land Commission 1).

1. **The "Agrarian Metaverse" (The Tool):**  
   * **Critique:** The speaker attacks the Rural Environmental Registry (CAR), established in 2012\.1 Being "self-declaratory" 1 amidst "land tenure chaos" and with low digital inclusion (less than 3% in 2012\) 1, the CAR became an instrument of simulation.  
   * **Claim 6.1:** He defined this phenomenon as "Agrarian Metaverse: the simulation of reality from the virtual world," citing his publication in the "notebooks of the São Paulo Public Defender's Office."1  
2. **The Private Market (The Conflicts):**  
   * **Claim 6.2 (Case 1: Breves):** He cited the CAR of the "Eco Mapuá" company 1, owned by businessman "Le Pichan," in Breves (Marajó). The 53,000-hectare CAR (part of 90,000 ha) 1 overlaps two federal Extractive Reserves (RESEX): Mapuá and Terra Grande Pracuúba.1 The CAR's purpose: "sell carbon credits" 1 for families who didn't even know the project existed.1  
   * **Claim 6.3 (Case 2: Portel):** He cited the case of Portel (Marajó) 1, which has 154% of its territory covered by CAR.1 He stated that 1 million hectares of carbon projects are superimposed on settlements 1, with 30-year contracts, no consultation, and "paltry" benefit-sharing (stoves, food baskets).1  
   * **Claim 6.4:** He cited his article "Carbon and Neocolonialism" 1, which estimates the value of these projects at US$ 115 million.1  
   * **Critique of Additionality:** He questioned the additionality of the Portel projects, which have existed since 2008 and have not reduced deforestation.1  
3. **The Public-Private Market (The Pará Agreement):**  
   * **Claim 6.5:** The speaker analyzed the hybrid model of the State of Pará 1, citing the announcement of a credit sale (Sept/2024) 1 to the "LEAF Coalition" (formed by governments and corporations like Amazon, Bayer, Nestlé).1  
   * **Claim 6.6 (Judicialization):** He stated that the announcement was challenged by the Federal (MPF) and State (MPE) Public Ministries for treating the forest as a "commodity" (future sale).1  
   * **Claim 6.7 (The Structure):** He detailed the actors: the certifier (Arctris) 1, the manager (Emergent, based in Delaware, a tax haven) 1, and the State's executive arm: the "Companhia de Ativos Ambientais e Participações do Pará, Sociedade Anônima" (CAAP S.A.).1  
   * **Claim 6.8 (The Price Critique):** He criticized the price of US$ 15/ton 1, set by LEAF 1, comparing it to the "Social Cost of Carbon" (SCC), which ECLAC 1 and "Rennet et al." 1 estimate at US$ 185/ton (or US$ 51/ton, the US government standard).

**Correction of Shortcomings and External Validation:**

* **Reference 6.1 (Agrarian Metaverse):** The claim 1 is validated. Sources 12 confirm the publication "Metaverso agrário: a simulação da realidade..." (Agrarian metaverse: the simulation of reality...) in the "Cadernos da Defensoria Pública do Estado de São Paulo" (Notebooks of the São Paulo State Public Defender's Office).  
* **Reference 6.2 (Eco Mapuá/Breves Conflict):** The claim 1 is 100% validated. Sources 11 detail the "Ecomapuá Amazon REDD Project" 11 of the Ecomapuá Conservação company (owned by Chan Lap Tak, or "Le Pichan" 38) and its overlap with the Mapuá and Terra Grande-Pracuúba RESEXs.11 The sources confirm the allegations of "harassment" and "lack of knowledge or consent" by the local association AMOREMA.11  
* **Reference 6.3 (Portel Conflict):** The claim 1 is 100% validated. Sources 10 confirm that the Pará Public Defender's Office (DPE-PA) filed Public Civil Actions (ACPs) 10 against REDD+ projects (such as VERRA projects 981, 997, 2252, and 2620 42) in Portel, alleging overlap with state settlements and grabbing of public lands.10  
* **Reference 6.4 (Article "Carbon and Neocolonialism"):** The claim 1 is 100% validated. Sources 9 confirm the publication of the article. The full reference is: **Ramos, C. A. P.; Miranda, I. C. R. F. de; Torres, M. G. (2024)**. The article's abstract 9 validates the exact numbers from the presentation (714,085 ha, US$ 115 million) and the thesis of "spoliation and expropriation."9  
* **Reference 6.5 (Pará/LEAF Agreement):** The claim 1 is 100% validated. Sources 14 confirm the agreement announced in September 2024 between Pará and the LEAF Coalition for the purchase of 12 million credits (2023-2026) at a price of US$ 15 per ton.14 The buyers (Amazon, Bayer, Nestlé, etc.) and the guaranteeing governments (USA, Norway, UK) 14 are also confirmed.  
* **Reference 6.7 (CAAP S.A.):** The claim 1 is 100% validated. The "Companhia de Ativos Ambientais e Participações do Pará S.A. (CAAPP)" 15 was authorized by **State Law No. 10,258 of December 11, 2023**.48 It is a mixed-capital (51% state-owned 15) joint-stock company whose object is the commercialization of environmental assets.15  
* **Reference 6.8 (Social Cost of Carbon):** The claim 1 about "Rennet et al." refers to the study by Rennert et al. (2022), published in *Nature*, which recalculated the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) to US$ 185/ton, contrasting with the US$ 51/ton (previous US standard) and the US$ 15 of the LEAF agreement.

## **VIII. Analysis of Presentation 7: Prof. Richard Toziano (FAO/UN)**

**Presentation Title:** "Land governance and territorial intelligence for forest protection."1

Discourse Analysis:  
Prof. Richard Toziano, former National Director of INCRA and consultant for FAO/UN 1, presented the structural diagnosis that ties together the market failures denounced by Prof. Ramos.

1. **The Thesis (The Diagnosis):** The speaker used the metaphor "be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater."1 The "baby" is the carbon market (a solution), but it is threatened by the "dirty water": Brazil's "profound land tenure insecurity."1  
2. **The Cause of the Problem:** The Brazilian State does not govern its territory because it does not know it.1 The speaker cited the existence of 50 million hectares of undesignated federal public lands in the Amazon.1 These areas are occupied by "invisible" communities 1 and are the target of land grabbing.  
3. **The Risk (Green Grabbing):**  
   * **Claim 7.1:** The speaker described the phenomenon of "Land Grabbing" 1 and its new form, "Green Grabbing" or "Green Neocolonization" 1, where international capital appropriates land for green projects, such as carbon.  
   * **Claim 7.2 (The Legal Loophole):** He identified the "Fiagro Law" 1 (Investment Funds for Agro-industrial Productive Chains) as an exception to **Law 5,709/1971** 1 (which limits land purchase by foreigners). The new law would allow international funds to bypass sovereignty controls and buy land for green speculation.1  
4. **The Solutions (The Governance Structure):** The speaker presented a tripod of technical solutions to resolve land tenure insecurity:  
   * **Claim 7.3 (The Principles):** The "Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure" (FAO, 2012\) 1, which establish the principles for protecting rights and preventing disputes.  
   * **Claim 7.4 (The Standard):** The "LADM (Land Administration Domain Model), ISO 19152."1 This is the international technical standard for a multi-purpose land registry, which integrates data and focuses on rights, restrictions, and responsibilities (RRRs).1  
   * **Claim 7.5 (The Tool):** The "Terra Analytics" platform 1, which (according to the speaker) is used by the federal government to integrate databases (CAR, SIGEF) and conduct territorial due diligence.1  
5. **The Anecdote (Liméu):** The speaker illustrated the land tenure chaos by citing the "Liméu" (Mean Ordinary High Water Mark) 1—Union (federal) lands that are not demarcated. He recounted cases where INCRA (where he was director) even expropriated and paid compensation for lands that, in fact, already belonged to the Union itself.1

**Correction of Shortcomings and External Validation:**

* Reference 7.2 (Fiagro Law vs. 5,709/1971): The claim 1 contains a temporal inaccuracy and an interpretation. The Fiagro Law is Law No. 14,130 of March 29, 2021 13 (the speaker cited 2018). Law No. 5,709/1971 does indeed restrict land purchase by foreigners. The critique that Fiagro functions as an "exception" or loophole to the 1971 Law,  
  allowing "Green Grabbing," is a current legal interpretation.  
* **Reference 7.3 (FAO Guidelines):** The claim 1 is 100% validated. Sources 51 confirm the full title: **"Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security"** (FAO, 2012). Its objective is precisely to protect local tenure rights against 'land grabbing.'51  
* **Reference 7.4 (LADM ISO 19152):** The claim 1 is 100% validated. Sources 53 confirm the **"Land Administration Domain Model (LADM)"** as the international standard **ISO 19152:2012**.56 It is a conceptual model to describe "relationships between people and land" 54, focused on Rights, Restrictions, and Responsibilities (RRRs).53  
* **Reference 7.5 (Terra Analytics):** The claim 1 is validated. The "Terra Analytics" platform 57 is a "Territorial Management and Land Regularization" service that integrates databases (CAR, SIGEF, SNCI) for overlap analysis and compliance.57

## **IX. Concluding Debates and Synthesis**

The final debate 1 synthesized the central tensions of the panel, focusing on the gap between scientific/economic potential and the reality of implementation.

1. **The Implementation Problem (Bioeconomy):** An audience member (Prof. Juliana) raised the issue of logistics 1, reporting the case of a riverside community that has production (bioeconomy) but cannot transport it.  
   * **Response (Prof. Danilo):** Prof. Danilo 1 used the question to validate his thesis. He stated that the debate focuses on "futurology" (exports), while "basic things" like logistics, sanitation, and "territorial development projects" are missing.  
   * **Supplement (Prof. Ramos):** Prof. Ramos 1 provided the crucial data that explains the implementation failure: 92% of PRONAF (National Program for Strengthening Family Agriculture) in the Amazon was allocated to cattle ranching.1 This demonstrates that public financing, though available, is allocated to the "mechanical-chemical paradigm" (cattle) and not the "organic paradigm" (bioeconomy), perpetuating the problem.  
2. **The Role of the University:** A debater 1 questioned how the university can overcome the tripod (teaching, research, extension) to generate real impact in society.  
   * **Response (Prof. Toziano):** Prof. Toziano 1 argued that academia must be more proactive, asking: "How many universities are \[...\] submitting \[projects\] to the Amazon Fund to benefit communities?" He warned that NGOs and foreign funds are occupying this space.1  
   * **Response (Prof. Juliana):** Prof. Juliana 1 and Prof. Iraê 1 concluded the panel by using the "Casa da Floresta" (House of the Forest) 24 as the practical answer. The initiative (UNESP/Piabiru/UFPA) represents the university "leaving its walls," establishing itself in the territory (Acará), listening to the community 1, and already applying its research (e.g., a low-carbon housing project with local materials 1).

Concluding Synthesis:  
The panel demonstrated that academia is providing the scientific tools (Presentations 1, 3, 4\) and economic models (Presentation 2\) for maintaining the standing forest. However, the application of these tools (Presentation 5\) is massively obstructed by structural governance failures (Presentations 6, 7). The final debate (on PRONAF and the Amazon Fund) sealed the diagnosis: without resolving the "profound land tenure insecurity" (Toziano) and the "agrarian metaverse" (Ramos), carbon markets and the bioeconomy run the risk of becoming, in practice, tools of "carbon neocolonialism."9
